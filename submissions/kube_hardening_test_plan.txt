To harden a Kubernetes cluster changes should not be applied to the production environment directly.
There should be a test environment that is used for testing changes before applying them to the production environment.
When these changes have been applied to the test environment, they should be tested extensively to ensure they do not break the environment.
Once the changes have been tested, they should not be rolled out immediately to the production environment.
Instead a Canary deployment should be created and deployed to the production environment.
This can be done by creating a new deployment with the new changes and then rolling out the canary deployment.
Once the canary deployment is rolled out, the canary deployment should be promoted to the production environment if no issues are found.
